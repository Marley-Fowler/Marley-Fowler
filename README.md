# Hi there!
I'm Marley, at the time of working on this, I'm 14 years old and am working on technical skills! Computing has been a large interest of mine since I was 8 years old, where I learned a simple moderation algorithm for a bot on a social media server using Node.js. AI is moderately intimidating for entry level positions, I imagine it will get worse by the time I'm an adult so I'm working on projects now to become appealing for the future.

I started working on github on 29/08/25
